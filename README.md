## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/InsightBridge.git
    cd InsightBridge
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file and add any necessary environment variables like API keys, database credentials, etc.

    Example:
    ```env
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=password
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
    ```

5. **Run the application**:
    - For the backend (Flask):
        ```bash
        flask run
        ```
    - For the frontend (React.js):
        ```bash
        npm install
        npm start
        ```

6. **Docker Setup (Optional)**:
    If you want to run the project in a Docker container, follow these steps:
    - Build the Docker image:
        ```bash
        docker build -t insightbridge .
        ```
    - Run the Docker container:
        ```bash
        docker run -p 5000:5000 insightbridge
        ```

## Usage

### Business Intelligence Assistant

Once the application is running, you can interact with the system through the web interface. The key functionalities are:

- **Dashboard**: View pre-configured or custom dashboards that track important business metrics.
- **Predictive Insights**: Get forecasts for sales, revenue, and customer trends.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Type in natural language queries like "What were our top sales last quarter?" and the system will respond with data-driven answers.
- **Data Analysis**: Automatically analyze data sets to uncover trends, outliers, and correlations.
